#### Cloning The GitHub Repository

The recommended way to get node-micro-service is to use git to directly clone the node-micro-service repository:

This will clone the latest version of the node-micro-service repository to a node-micro-service folder.

Downloading The Repository Zip File

Another way to use the node-micro-service boilerplate is to download a zip copy from the master branch on GitHub. You can also do this using the wget command:

$ wget https://github.com/roshanraj/node-micro-service.git -O node-micro-service.zip; unzip node-micro-service.zip; rm node-micro-service.zip
Don't forget to rename node-micro-service after your project name.

To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:
```
$ npm install
```
